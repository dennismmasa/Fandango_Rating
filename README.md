# Fandango_Rating

This project is meant to analyze fandangos movie rating. Previous work by Hickey criticized fandango for rounding up all the rating therefore giving it higher rating than the real ones. Fandango claimed that was a bug and has then fixed the problem.

The aim of this is to compare those datasets to see if there is a change in the ratings. Hickeys data is from 2015 and the new data is from 2016. We will look at different ways on how these data are different
